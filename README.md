# DesignPatterns using C#

what is a singelton pattern?
Only create one instance of a class.
if we want a class to hav only one object, then we use the singleton pattern 



why do we need only one object of a class?
objects used for logging, device drivers for printers or registry setting need 
to have only one of a kind. if there are multipe obejcts we may encounter problems like 
incorrect program behavior, inconsistent results etc.
